# Language Acquisition
Using ChatGPT Whisper API for real-time conversation in an attempt to improve language acquisition.

I speak 3 languages and have attempted to learn several more. I always find that the most difficult part of learning a new language in a country where it is not spoken is achieving conversational fluency without partners. This app allows real-time verbal communication using ChatGPT. By selecting only the language you'd like to speak and the level you currently fit, you can initiate a conversation at any level and have a partner that prompts, challenges, affirms, and corrects you.
